 * This program recreates the Wheel of Fortune game, using GUI components to create an interactive experience
 * where the user can click buttons and enter input on a screen to see results of the game.


INSTRUCTIONS:
    - When a player's turn begins, they have the option to click one of three buttons. The "SPIN WHEEL" button spins a
      wheel with outcomes of "lose a turn", "bankrupt", or $100, $200, $300, $400, $500, $600. If the player successfully
      guesses a consonant in the word, they recieve the number of consonants in the word times the amount of money spun.
      The "BUY A VOWEL" button allows the player to spend $250 to buy a vowel. The "SOLVE" button allows the player to
      attempt to solve the puzzle. Each player's money for the current game and money for the total match are kept on
      the screen. The player only recieves money from a game if they win that game. The puzzle is updated towards the top
      of the screen and the game number is updated towards the bottom. Simplified instructions are also on the screen.
