 * This program recreates the Wheel of Fortune game, using GUI components to create an interactive experience
 * where the user can click buttons and enter input on a screen to see results of the game.


INSTRUCTIONS:
    - When a player's turn begins, they have the option to click one of three buttons. The "SPIN WHEEL" button spins a
      wheel with outcomes of "lose a turn", "bankrupt", or $100, $200, $300, $400, $500, $600. If the player successfully
      guesses a consonant in the word, they recieve the number of consonants in the word times the amount of money spun.
      The "BUY A VOWEL" button allows the player to spend $250 to buy a vowel. The "SOLVE" button allows the player to
      attempt to solve the puzzle. Each player's money for the current game and money for the total match are kept on
      the screen. The player only recieves money from a game if they win that game. The puzzle is updated towards the top
      of the screen and the game number is updated towards the bottom. Simplified instructions are also on the screen.


GUI OBJECTS USED:
    - JTABLE: I used a JTable as one of my GUI objects that is used to display simplified instructions of what each button does
      onto the screen.
    - JOPTIONPANE: I used multiple JOptionPane's throughput my code for different purposes. Some simply displayed a message,
      such as notifying a user when their guess was incorrect. Other's promted for input, such as asking the user for a
      consonant; I then took that input and was able to check if it was correct or not; based on whether it was correct or
      not, I used another JOptionPane to display another message.


SPECIAL FEATURE:
    - My special feature for this program is that the user can enter their own name. As opposed to just "player 1" and "player 2",
      the user is asked to input their name with a JOptionPane at the beginning of the game, allowing a user to add a personal
      touch to the game.
